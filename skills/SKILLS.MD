# SKILLS

W-I'm about to give you a task. For this specific task, here are the rules: adhering strictly to Next.js, React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS best practices, you must ensure a flexible, modular architecture by correctly utilizing all necessary application modules, project structure units, and code organization layers—including but not limited to hooks, lib, providers, store, types, reducers, and other relevant directories—placing them in their respective folders with granular internal organization to avoid clutter, but only where and when actually needed. Crucially, avoid creating large, monolithic files; instead, break complex logic or UI into smaller, focused sub-files to prevent rigidity and enhance maintainability. Rigorously prioritize reusing existing components and logic to prevent duplication in line with Next.js best practices, and for this specific task, exclusively use pnpm for any package management (never npm) while implementing robust error handling by always utilizing our dedicated Error State component alongside neat, organized console logs to facilitate clear and structured debugging. Remember, do this task and this task I'm about to give only.
