### **Recruiter**

A **recruiter** is someone whose job is to **find people to fill job positions**. They search for qualified candidates, talk to them, review their CVs, and connect them to companies that are hiring. Recruiters can work **inside a company** (internal recruiters) or work for a **separate recruiting agency**. Their main focus is *finding* the right person for the job, not running the company. They help with the hiring process but **do not own or manage the business**.

### **Employer**

An **employer** is the **person or company that gives you the job**. They are the ones who pay your salary, set your work duties, and provide the workplace. Employers manage the business, make decisions, and are responsible for the employees they hire. They are the *final decision-makers* in choosing who gets the job. So while a recruiter finds candidates, the employer is the one who **actually hires and employs** the person.
