### 1. User Type Capabilities

While both roles share the "Posting" feature, their depth of access differs significantly:

| Feature | Employer | Recruiter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Post Jobs** | Yes | Yes |
| **Manage Applicants (Internal)** | Yes (Full Suite) | Yes (Limited to specific job) |
| **AI Analysis & Reporting** | Yes | No |
| **Employee Management Tools** | **Yes** (Onboarding, Payroll, etc.) | **No** |
| **Relationship** | Owns the Organization | Connects talent to the Employer |

### 3. Summary of your Logic

To ensure I have this right:

* **Recruiters** are "Lead Generators." They find people and pass them off, either via an external link or by managing a specific pool of applicants within your app. They do not have access to the long-term "Employee Management" side.
* **Employers** are "Business Owners." They use the hiring tools, but they also have the full "Employer Experience" (managing the people once they are hired).
* **External Links** = Analytics only (Clicks).
* **Internal Apps** = Full Management (AI, Reports, Profiles).
